Identification of Improvement Potentials to Promote Sustainability of Energy  Efficiency of Outdated Cutting Machine Tools 

When we are using existing machine tools we don't know when a
drill bit will wear off or not so if a process is going on and the drill
wears off we have to stop the process and start it again with new
bit for the same material so waste of time waste of energy and
waste of material. We develop an ML algorithm to rectify this error in real time.
